<h2>Structure of the task</h2>
<p>In the task, letters are presented on the screen consecutively. The users' task is to press the "J" key on the keyboard for the target elements, and the "F" for the non-target elements. The target stimulus differs between the different level of the task. The task begins with written instructions. Before the two blocks, a 10-trial practice is implemented. During the practice, the users receive feedback about their answer ("Correct", "Wrong", "You did not respond"). After the practice, the two 50-trial long blocks begin. Between blocks, a self-paced rest period is inserted. After the end of the second block, the users receive feedback about there overall success rate and reaction time.</p>

<h2>The levels of the task</h2>
Depending on the value of the <i>level</i> variable (can be modified in <i>parameters.js</i>), 0-back, 1-back, 2-back and 3-back will be performed.
<ul>
 <li><strong>0-back:</strong> The target element is the letter "X".</li>
 <li><strong>1-back:</strong> The target is any letters which were preceeded by the same letter (n is target if n=n-1, where <i>n</i> is the current stimulus on the screen).</li> 
 <li><strong>2-back:</strong> The target is any letters which were preceeded by the same letter 2 trials earlier (n is target if n=n-2, where <i>n</i> is the current stimulus on the screen).</li>
 <li><strong>3-back:</strong> The target is any letters which were preceeded by the same letter 3 trials earlier (n is target if n=n-3, where <i>n</i> is the current stimulus on the screen).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stimulus presentation parameters</h2>
<p>Ten, phonologically distint letters are used as stimuli (B, K, Q, T, H, M, N, P, X, R). The letters are presented in a fixed pseudo-random order. Each letter is presented for 500 ms with an interstimulus interval of 1500 ms. Stimuli are presented in two 50-trial blocks (100 trials altogether at each level). In the 0-back version, the target X is presented 20 times. Therefore, the target-ratio is set to 20% at each level (20 target trials vs. 80 non-target trials).In the 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back versions, each letter is presented 10 times, and all of them serves as target 2 times (once in each block). After then end of the task, an output file is saved to the local machine in .csv format.</p>

<h2>How to start the task</h2>
Open the <i>index.html</i> file in either the <i>offline</i> or <i>online</i> folder. When the offline version is started, you can customize the subject and session numbers (any number is accepted). If you start the offline version, a random subject ID will be allocated.
